# Documentation

[The documentation is available in mia_processes's website](https://populse.github.io/mia_processes).

# Installation

* A compatible version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) (>= 3.5) and [pip](https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/) must be installed.

* Depending on the Python setup and OS, the “python3” command can be use as the default Python command.

    Try:
        `python -V`

    If it returns `Python 3.x.x`, replace all the `python3` commands below by `python`.

    If not installed, install it ...

 * Make sure to have pip installed.

    Try:
        `pip -V`

    If it returns a path including `/python3.x/`, replace all the `pip3` commands below by `pip`.

    If not installed, install it ...

* From PyPI

  * [Install the latest version of mia_processes and its dependencies from the Python Packaging Index](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html):

        pip3 install mia_processes # depending of the setup, it could be necessary to add --user option

* From source, for Linux distributions.

  * Install a Version Control System, for example [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). Depending of your distribution, [package management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) can be different:

        sudo apt-get install git # Debian like
        sudo dnf install git # Fedora 22 and later
        # etc.

  * Clone the source codes.

    * Get source codes from Github. Replace [mia_processes_install_dir] with a directory of your choice:

          git clone https://github.com/populse/mia_processes.git [mia_processes_install_dir]

    * Or download the zip file (mia_processes-master.zip) of the project ([green button "Clone or download"](https://github.com/populse/mia_processes)), then extract the data in the directory of your choice ([mia_processes_install_dir]):

          unzip mia_processes-master.zip -d [mia_processes_install_dir]  # In this case [mia_processes_install_dir] becomes [mia_processes_install_dir]/mia_processes-master

  * Install the Python module distribution:

        cd [mia_processes_install_dir]
        python3 setup.py install # depending of the setup, it could be necessary to add --user option

  * Remove the [mia_processes_install_dir] directory:

        cd ..
        rm -r [mia_install_dir]

# Third-party softwares

Many mia_processes bricks (atomic processes) use third-party softwares. To use these bricks, the corresponding [third-party softwares must be installed](https://populse.github.io/populse_mia/html/installation/3rd-party_installations.html).


# Requirements

In order to get all the bricks and pipelines proposed by mia_processes some third libraries are required:
* dipy
* nibabel
* nilearn
* nipy
* nipype
* nitime
* nitransforms
* numpy
* populse_db >=2.1.0
* populse_mia >= 2.2.0
* reportlab
* scipy
* statsmodels
* templateflow
* torch
